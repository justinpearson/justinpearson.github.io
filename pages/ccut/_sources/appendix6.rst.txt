**What did you like most about your SST experience?**


- I was able to learn to program and use actual robots to do it.

- The application of coding and information on control theory, as well as the usement of technology in everyday life.

- The learning

- I learned more about science and met new people.

- Hands on programming and working with the robots.

- Everything it was fun.

- Getting to learn how to operate the robots.

- Meeting new people.

- Learning the concepts.

- I really liked the kind instructors and the great food offered after every class.


**What was the most interesting topic you covered in class?**


- Everything to be honest, converting bits and bytes, as well as programming on java.

- Control theory, java, realterm

- To me the most interesting topic was the converting of regular numbers into the same amount but in 0+1s

- The control theory and java.

- Actually programming the robots.

- Programming using Java.

- How to stabilize the beam at a 90 degree angle.

- Control.

- The most interesting topic we covered for me was schematics and how it can apply to a physical system.



**If you were to take this class again, what suggestions would you have for improvement?**


- Be able to have the classes longer.

- A hands on example by the teachers first.

- I don't know.

- To use other programs beside JAVA.

- A little more time working with the robots.

- None, the time was not all too many so their was nothing that they could be done.

- Get an understanding of how the insides of a computer can translate code.

- I would just suggest a larger of classes of 8-10 weeks.



**What did you like about the instructor's teaching style?**


- I liked how he was able to explain complicated concepts in a simple way.

- They explained everything clearly and to the point, they also used examples.

- They helped you and actually explained what you didn't get in a friendly way.

- I liked that they would let us ask questions and did not make it so different.

- They both were very clear and conAnd were able to answer any questions we had.

- The relaxed teaching style.

- I like his power pointsw with exmaples to get a much easier explanation.

- Quick to the point but with some supplementary stuff thrown in.

- Don't know exactly.

- They were both very real and upfront with us and always allowed us to have a variety of experience.




**How could the instructor improve on their teaching?**


- They did a great job teaching.

- Perfect/more hands on activities.

- I don't know.

- The instructor did a good job.

- From what I experienced they both did very well.

- They did the best they could in the time provided.

- Going step by step on the programs for the laptops to help the student understand how to set up.

- Was very good so I don't know what there is to be improved.

- I was just not sure how to organize or interpret the coding concepts well enough to implement them extensively.
