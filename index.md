# About me

## Work

Since 2018, I've worked at AppFolio
[![Link to AppFolio]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/misc/external-link.svg)](https://www.appfolio.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer (2018–2020, 2025–present) and an Engineering Manager (2021–2024),
developing web-based software for managing the leasing, maintenance, and accounting operations of rental properties. Details:
**[AppFolio]({{site.baseurl}}/industry.html#appfolio).**

From 2008 to 2012, I programmed autonomous airplanes at AeroVironment
[![Link to AeroVironment]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/misc/external-link.svg)](https://www.avinc.com/).
I designed and implemented control algorithms for the Global Observer aircraft:
a giant high-altitude long-endurance prototype spyplane powered by liquid hydrogen.
I deployed to Edwards Air Force Base for the aircraft's 15-month flight-test campaign.
Afterward

I transferred to AeroVironment's Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems division,
where I programmed guidance and navigation algorithms for
hand-launched short-range military reconnaissance drones.

## Learning

I studied mechanical engineering at the University of California at Santa Barbara (B.S. 2001--2006),
control systems at Stanford University (M.S. 2006--2007),
and resource-constrained control theory at UCSB (Ph.D. 2012--2017).
More details here: **[Résumé]({{site.baseurl}}/resume.html).**

From 2012 to 2017, I earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering
under Professor Jo&#227;o Hespanha 
[![Joao's Homepage]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/misc/external-link.svg)](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~hespanha/) 
in the Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation
[![CCDC Homepage]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/misc/external-link.svg)](http://www.ccdc.ucsb.edu).
My research focused on bandwidth-limited control theory and
the design of controllers that are resistant to operating-system preemption.

## Teaching

I'm passionate about teaching and communicating clearly.

In grad school, I earned UCSB's Certificate in College and University Teaching
[![CCUT Homepage]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/misc/external-link.svg)](http://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/academic/interdisciplinary-emphases-certificate-programs/ccut),
a certificate program for teaching-oriented graduate students.
This required studying pedagogy, designing and running educational outreach programs,
and planning and teaching a course as Instructor of Record.
You can view my CCUT Portfolio website and watch my video about it here:
**[Teaching]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching.html).**

AppFolio has teaching and mentoring opportunities as well:
I've mentored interns, helped organize our new-hire onboarding program,
and taught multiple workshops from our "Engineering Academy" ---
a set of 50 one-hour hands-on learning sessions, taught at various cadences,
that get employees up to speed on our technology stack and our culture.
