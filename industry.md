## AppFolio (2018--present)
{: #appfolio}

AppFolio ([appfolio.com](https://www.appfolio.com))
sells web-based SaaS software to landlords, for managing the leasing, maintenance, and accounting
operations of rental properties. Most people know AppFolio through its companion app for renters
([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/online-portal-by-appfolio/id1376350358), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appfolio.resident_portal)),
where you can pay your rent, submit maintenance requests, and message your landlord.

The engineering work is interesting, difficult, and technical,
yet the core business concepts are grounded in reality:
money, apartments, tenants, text messages, leaky faucets, electricians, pet deposits, etc.
Our customers (property managers, aka landlords) are down-to-earth and they appreciate us.
These are nice qualities to have in a job.

The company was founded by an engineer and a computer science professor,
and it maintains a strong engineering backbone:
Our engineering teams are multi-disciplinary, meaning that each team
has everyone it needs to add new features to our software:
a few software engineers, a Quality Assurance engineer,
a User-Experience designer, and a Product Manager.
We strive to be agile, but we're not dogmatic about it.
We aim for each team to autonomously and continuously deliver value
to our customers. We strive to uphold our sensible company values, like:

- Simpler is better.
- Small, focused teams keep us agile.
- Listening to our customers is in our DNA.

AppFolio is currently a good size: big enough to offer stable employment,
yet still small enough to give engineers autonomy; for example,
engineers can talk directly to customers and they love it. For example:

**"YES! YES! YES! Wow… I'm excited that a live person actually got back to me. You guys really do read our feedbacks. 😊 "**

Below are a few personal highlights of my work at AppFolio.

## AeroVironment (2008--2012)
{: #aerovironment}

Here are some highlights of the Global Observer airplane program
that I worked on for four years (2008--2012) at AeroVironment ([avinc.com](http://www.avinc.com)).

The Global Observer system is designed to work like a 12-mile-high,
redeployable satellite to provide coverage over an area of up to 600 miles in diameter.
Global Observer will be capable of supporting multiple high-value applications,
including:

- Communications relay
- Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR)
missions for defense and homeland security
- Storm tracking
- Telecommunications infrastructure
- Wildfire detection/tracking
- Maritime operations
- Disaster recovery services
