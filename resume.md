    This file (resume.md) is my current (June 2025) source-of-truth
    for my resume. I want my resume to be in a more web-friendly
    format than Microsoft Word or Google Docs or Mac Pages.

    WARNING: If you modify this file, you also need to re-generate the PDF resume too, see:
    DOC/how-to-update-job-title-or-resume.md
