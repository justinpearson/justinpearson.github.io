- title: An architecture for preemption-resistant control (Ph.D. Defense, Part 2)

  summary: >
    We present a control architecture that allows a controller running on a non-real-time operating system
    to run with a high degree of determinacy, even in the presence of OS preemption.
    The main idea is to buffer the sensor measurements and actuator commands on an auxiliary
    microprocessor called a Real-Time Unit (RTU). The RTU runs independently from the main CPU and so can
    function even if the main control task is preempted. We implement this on a 1 GHz Beaglebone Black
    single-board computer using its 200 MHz Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU) as an RTU. 
    We observe that this architecture greatly improves the performance of a simple PID controller 
    in the presence of OS preemption.

    We presented these results at my Ph.D. defense in January 2018.

    Control with minimum energy-per-symbol, and the optimality
    of event-based control (Ph.D. Defense, Part 1)
  video: /assets/research/mineng-animation.mp4
  summary: >
    The performance of a control system is often limited by constraints on timing, bandwidth, and energy. 
    This work explores the trade-offs between constraints on these resources, the control system performance, 
    and the system to be controlled. We begin by considering a networked control system in which the sensor
    sends its measurements to the controller over a limited-bandwidth communications channel. 
    We explore the observation that the absence of communication nevertheless conveys 
    information --- i.e., nothing communication-worthy occurred. 
    This suggests that energy (or other resources consumed by communication) could be saved using 
    the *timing* of messages to transmit information, rather than the normal practice 
    of transmitting data in the messages themselves. We develop a framework to explore this idea and 
    derive a condition for the existence of a stabilizing controller that captures the trade-off 
    between bandwidth, resource consumption, and the unstable eigenvalues of the linear system 
    to be controlled. Next, we use the framework to analyze a family of event-based controllers. 
    We show that these controllers can stabilize a system while consuming resources at a rate 
    that is within 2.5 times the theoretically-minimum rate. 

    We presented these results at the 2015 and 2016 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,
    in the May 2017 issue of the IEEE journal *Transactions on Automatic Control*, and at my Ph.D. defense in Jan 2018.

    To explore the importance of timing in control systems, we implement a pendulum controller on a Beaglebone single-board computer.

    This video is an overview of the hardware and an introduction to state-feedback controllers.

  summary: >
    Paxos is a computer algorithm to help a network of computers agree on a
    proposed value. It is hard to understand at first. This video attempts to
    explain Paxos intuitively yet rigorously. The content comes from Lamport's
    2001 paper "Paxos Made Simple".
