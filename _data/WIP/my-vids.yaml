  summary: >
    A tour of the Controls Lab at the University of California at Santa Barbara, for incoming first-year undergraduate students in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

    0:35 - what is control theory? example: cruise controller
    7:40 - inverted pendulum hardware
    12:15 - humans try to balance 
    15:48 - computer balances pendulum
    18:00 - balancing with additional setpoints
    19:03 - unmodeled vibrational modes


    The lab is located in Harold Frank Hall room 3120A. It features five Quanser inverted pendulum stations used in the ECE 147A,B,C course series, as well as several LEGO MindStorms robots used in ECE 179D.

    Paxos is a computer algorithm to help a network of computers agree on a
    proposed value. It is hard to understand at first. This video attempts to
    explain Paxos intuitively yet rigorously. The content comes from Lamport's
    2001 paper "Paxos Made Simple".
