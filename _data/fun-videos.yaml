    I'm "playing" one of my favorite Cynic Project songs on this sliding glass door. 
    I used the Adobe After Effects editor; each "key" is an adjustment layer with 
    time-varying keyframes that automatically repeat with a period determined by the song's tempo.

    My sister Steph had her 20th birthday around the time I was learning Adobe After Effects. 
    My brother and I whipped this up for her. I don't think you can buy toilet seats that do this any more.
    The effects use adjustment layers that translate by tracking the hearts on the seat.
