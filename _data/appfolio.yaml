- title: Recruiting event at Northeastern University
  summary: >
    My intern Ciarra and I gave a job talk at NEU about AppFolio
    and the career-growth opportunities it offers. Ciarra talked about
    her experience on our "team of new-hires" --- an excellent "customer testamonial".
    We had lines out the door of hopeful students!

- title: Project Sea Cucumber (Customer Visit)
  summary: >
    AppFolio's software engineers love writing useful software. Who doesn't like 
    feeling appreciated? And what better way to feel appreciated for your 
    useful software than by parachuting an engineering team into a customer's office
    and delighting them by adding some new desired feature to our software, right before their eyes??

- title: Leading a team of new-hires
  summary: >
    In 2019 I led a new team of new-hires: two new software engineering interns,
    a new QA intern, a new Product Manager, and a 3-month-old UX Designer. We worked hard, 
    delivered value to our customers, and had a ton of fun along the way. The interns 
    did a great job and we hired them full-time. My intern Ciarra wrote up her
    experience on AppFolio's Engineering blog.

- title: The Smile Machine (Hack Day project)
  summary: >
    For Hack Day at AppFolio, John and I created the "Smile Machine" --- two helmets 
    armed with Raspberry Pi-powered cameras that pop a water balloon on your head
    when you smile. Since then, the Smile Machines have become a venerable tradition
    at AppFolio, most recently to celebrate our interns with an intern-vs-mentor 
    staredown extravaganza.
