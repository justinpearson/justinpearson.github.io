    From the [UCSB Graduate Division site on the CCUT](http://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/academic/interdisciplinary-emphases-certificate-programs/ccut): 
    The UCSB Certificate in College and University Teaching (CCUT) is designed for students 
    who wish to demonstrate superior competence and experience in teaching at the university or college level. 
    Certificate requirements include completion or attainment of a number of teaching-related skills and experiences culminating 
    in independent instruction of an entire course with the support of a UCSB faculty mentor. 
    Students interested in getting the certificate thus need to obtain a position as an
    independent instructor either as a Teaching Associate in the regular or summer session
    on campus or at an off-campus junior college, college, or university location.
    Certificates are awarded in conjunction with a Ph.D. or MFA degree upon completion.

  summary: >
    This workshop helps teachers plan their lessons, engage their students,
    and assess their teaching. I presented this to new Teaching Assistants
    (1st-year graduate students) at UC Santa Barbara's 2017 Teaching Assistant Orientation.
  content: >
    **Workshop synopsis:**  *TAing Engineering Sections*: Engineering and its practitioners
    have the reputation for being boring and impenetrable. In this workshop we will
    discuss ways to structure your lessons and promote student interaction so that
    your students find you and your discipline lively, accessible, and most importantly,
    valuable to their future careers.

  summary: >
    A diverse group of high-school students from Santa Barbara and Bakersfield
    learn the basics of programming and mobile robotics over 5 Saturdays in this hands-on workshop.
  content: >
    The School of Scientific Thought (SST) is an outreach program offered
    twice a year by the Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships at UCSB.
    Over the course of 5 Saturdays, roughly 70 high-school students come to UCSB
    to participate in hands-on courses prepared by UCSB graduate students.
    Each high-school student is assigned to a course based on his or her preferences.
    The courses vary from year to year, depending on the available graduate students.
    After each 2-hour course session, the students and mentors from all the courses meet for lunch.
    This gives the students a chance to talk to the mentors in an informal setting,
    and ask them questions about college. At the end of the five week program,
    the students get certificates. The main goal of the SST program is to give
    high-school students a glimpse into what college is all about, and to get them
    excited about continuing their education after high-school.

- title: Probability Notation - Explained
  id: probability
  date: June 2015
  image: /assets/teaching/learning-glass.jpg
  summary: >
    Probability theory often confuses students. This is because the notation is
    often highly abbreviated and mathematically sloppy. In this video we discuss
    a few mathematical concepts underlying this notation,
    scrutinizing a common equation found in an introductory probability course.

  summary: >
    Today we use the equals sign (=) as shorthand for "is equal to,"
    but also as shorthand for "is denoted by" or "is defined as".
    This ambiguity causes much confusion in students. In this video,
    we explore the history of the notation and some hilarious consequences of the ambiguity.
