    What's the shortest path through my grocery store that gets
    all the items on my shopping list? We apply Mathematica's powerful
    image-processing and graph-search algorithms to a real map of my
    local grocery store to figure it out.

  summary: >
    This code illustrates an algorithm from an Dutch economics paper about object allocation.
    Consider the problem of allocating *n* objects to *n* people.
    Typically folks with crappy objects would envy the folks
    with desirable objects. But what if winners of the nice objects
    paid money to the folks who won the crappy objects?
    The paper presents an algorithm for figuring out how much
    money would need to be transferred so that no one
    envies anyone else.

  summary: >
    This project implements the MapReduce parallel computing algorithm and the Multi-Paxos distributed consensus algorithm.
    The code uses MapReduce to parallelize the computation of a word tally of several large text files;
    then it uses Multi-Paxos to distribute those tallies among two other computers in the form of a replicated log.
    The code runs on the Eucalyptus Cloud Computing infrastructure (similar to AWS).

  summary: My information-theory-based entry into the 2015 [Art of Science](http://art-csep.cnsi.ucsb.edu/) competition run by UCSB's Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships.
  content: >
    We stream movies, send pictures to friends, and video-chat with distant loved ones,
    all digitally, and all without a second thought. Empowering this revolution behind
    the scenes is Information Theory, which provides a mathematical framework to quantify,
    compress, and transmit information.

    This picture illustrates an important theorem in Information Theory:
    the Asymptotic Equipartition Property. It formalizes and generalizes the
    intuitive notion that if you flip a fair coin many times, you would expect
    about 50% heads. In the image, each square represents a string of coinflips
    (with 0=tails and 1=heads), with smaller squares representing longer strings
    of flips. Like a family tree, each square recursively generates 4 squares
    below it by appending one of 4 suffixes: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Each square is black,
    but is made transparent depending on how close to "50% heads" its corresponding
    string of coinflips is. We see that the vast majority of the tiny squares at
    the bottom are nearly 50% heads and hence transparent, allowing the underlying
    Swiss pasture scene to show through.

    One hundred lemmings are spaced 1-meter apart on a 101-meter plank in the water.
    You pick the initial direction of each lemming; each moves at 1m/s
    until it hits another lemming, at which point they each reverse direction.
    When all the lemmings are in the water, the game is over.
    Choose the initial directions of the lemmings to make the game last as long as possible
    (at least one lemming still on the plank).
