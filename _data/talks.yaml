  summary: >
    \"Set\" is a pattern-matching card game. In this project we describe 
    a Mathematica program to play Set over a USB video camera. 
    This requires some interesting image processing, including developing 
    a shape classifier using a probabilistic machine learning algorithm 
    called multinomial logistic regression.

  summary: >
    Can a Beaglebone Black balance a pendulum? The answer is a resounding yes...
    thanks to our friend, Control Theory. In this talk, we present an overview
    of the Quanser pendulum hardware, the Beaglebone Black, and state-feedback controllers.

  summary: >
    What do an airplane, a pancreas, and a warehouse have in common?
    It's no joke: the answer is that they are all systems whose behavior
    we want to control. In Control Theory, we use math to describe how
    systems behave, then design algorithms to control them.

    This talk introduces the Kalman Filter: an algorithm for efficiently
    estimating the state of a system from noisy measurements.
    Presented at the Dynamical Neuroscience Symposium,
    University of California, Santa Barbara.

  summary: >
    *\"Why should I learn Mathematica when I already have to learn Matlab??\"*


    This talk, geared toward college freshman engineering students,
    answers this question by highlighting Mathematica's strengths in comparison to Matlab.
    It's meant as a short introduction to whet the appetites of students eager
    to expand their engineering toolboxes.

  summary: >
    The Kalman Filter allows control engineers to employ celebrated
    state-­feedback controllers even when the system's state was not
    directly measurable, in a plug­-and-­play sort of way. This talk
    explains the basics of control theory and linear systems, describes
    the Kalman Filter, and shows some cool examples. Presented at SIAM
    Seminar on Top Algorithms in Computational Science.

- title: "MATLAB to Mathematica: An Engineering Student's Perspective"
  image: /assets/talks/matlab-to-mma.jpg
  id: mma-student
  date: May 2016
  summary: >
    UCSB electrical and computer engineering graduate student
    Justin Pearson shows how engineering equations can be both
    simplified and physically insightful using the Wolfram Language
    as compared to procedures in MATLAB.
